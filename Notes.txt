-An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses)
-HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages)
-An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it
delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
-whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via
HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP server accepts the request, finds
the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested
document, it returns a 404 response instead.)
-To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.
-Node.js is a single-threaded event-driven platform that is capable of running non-blocking, asynchronously programming.
-Open a File: The fs.open() method is used to create, read, or write a file.

    PATH is a path on the server.
    HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.
